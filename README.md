# whrtostudy
HacknRoll 2025

Built by Kabil, Mitchell and Kent, WhrtoStudy is a web application that allows students to find study spots around Singapore. Students themselves can suggest new study spots and see the current capacity so they won't waste their trip down to a study spot they can't secure.

Our tech stack is Python for the backend, and we used the streamlit library for the frontend. Our web app is hosted on Streamlit Cloud.
