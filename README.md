# WhrtoStudy
Built by Kabil, Mitchell and Kent during NUS HacknRoll 2025 from 18/01/2025 1215 (GMT +8) - 19/01/2025 1215 (GMT +8)

## Inspiration
As students, we felt frustrated when we go to our usual study spot and find it swarmed with too many people. We would then have to waste time finding another spot to study, with no guarantee that there would be seats available for us.

## What it does
WhrtoStudy lets students see study spots around the island and check how many people are already present at the study spot. The platform also lets students check if there are facilities nearby, such as toilets, WiFi, and charging ports.

## Our Tech Stack
Built with:
* Python using Streamlit framework
* Supabase database platform
* and most importantly, love

## Challenges we ran into
* Weird glitches from pressing/clicking buttons too quickly
* Trying to integrate the frontend with backend database

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Attempting a hackathon for the first time
  * Producing something that works in 24 hours

## What we learned
* Time is best spent exploring and refining what idea you would like to develop, especially when under time constraints
* Rapid prototyping principles are essential to expedite the completion of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
  * Focus on the core features of the MVP that need to be done before adding non-essential features
  * Deploy often to test faster and "fail" faster, which allows for quicker refinements

## What's next for WhrtoStudy
Future developments include:
* Adding more study spots
* Implementing analytics such as an hourly trend of every study spot so students know when it's crowded
* Use other technologies that can better handle high loads
* Improve the UI/UX
* Idiot proof the buttons.
